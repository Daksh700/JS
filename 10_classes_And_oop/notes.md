Javascript has a prototypal behaviour 
// If javascript does not find what you are looking for then it will go one layer above like accessing parents, grandparents and grand grandparents till it does not get null value. (This is the prototypal behaviour). The prototype is the keyword which gives access to new keyword, classes, this, prototypal inheritance (prototype inside a prototype).

// Everything is Object inside JS and ex - Array also has the access to the same properties of an object (inheritance) 

// Object does not have any parent so the prototype reference that you get is null
